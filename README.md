Python Bluetooth Motion Data Integration for Game Movements
This Python application connects to an iPhone over Bluetooth, retrieves motion data, and uses it to control movements in a game. By leveraging the iPhone's built-in sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.), this app maps physical movements to virtual actions in a game, providing an interactive and immersive experience.

Features:
Bluetooth Connectivity: Seamlessly connects to an iPhone via Bluetooth to retrieve real-time motion data.
Motion Data Retrieval: Collects accelerometer, gyroscope, and other motion sensor data from the iPhone.
Game Integration: Maps motion data to in-game movements, allowing users to control characters or elements based on physical actions.
Real-Time Data Streaming: Continuously streams motion data and updates in the game without noticeable delay.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
pybluez (for Bluetooth communication)
pygame (for game integration)
iphone-motion-sensor library (or equivalent, depending on the iPhone API used)
iPhone with Bluetooth enabled
Game with integration points for motion-based control (e.g., Pygame or custom game engine)
Installation:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bluetooth-motion-game.git
cd bluetooth-motion-game
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your iPhone and pair it with your computer.

Ensure you have the necessary iOS app or service running on the iPhone to send motion data via Bluetooth.

Usage:
Start the Python application to connect to the iPhone over Bluetooth:

bash
Copy
Edit
python connect_bluetooth.py
The app will automatically detect the connected iPhone and begin receiving motion data.

Once the connection is established, you can run the game that uses motion data for control:

bash
Copy
Edit
python game_integration.py
Perform physical movements (e.g., tilt, shake, etc.) to control the game in real-time.

Example:
In the game, tilting the iPhone forward will move the character forward, rotating it left or right will change the character's direction, and shaking the phone could trigger an action like jumping.

Troubleshooting:
Bluetooth Connection Issues: Ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on both your computer and iPhone. Re-pair the devices if necessary.
Motion Data Not Detected: Verify that the motion-sensing app on the iPhone is running and properly sending data.
